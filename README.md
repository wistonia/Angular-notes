# Angular-notes
Working notes for an Angular, Node, Express application

Introduction
--
Single page applications need to be served from somewhere, usually there are some server side resources or processing that must be performed. One option is to combine Angular on the client side with Express.js on the server. The benefit is only needing to program in one language, and make use of common libraries and code structures.

While tutorials for Angular exist, few explain how to set up the server side. On the other hand, there are many complete stack examples which often incorporate a vast number of different frameworks and utilities. Learning the capabilities and interactions of these systems is generally impractical without previous experience.
Many of the samples available on the web represent weeks of set up, they never mention the debugging and refactoring that went into making them work.

The purpose of this repository is to document setting up a full application framework without doing any _magic_. The introduction of each new library and configuration file will come with an explanation. When things don't work the reason why will be documented.
